This application was built using the Create React App framework.

How to Use
In the project folder, you can execute the following commands:

npm start
Starts the development server.\
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see the app.

The application supports hot reloading, so changes will reflect immediately.\
Any linting errors will also be shown in the console.

npm test
Initiates the test suite in watch mode.\
For details, refer to the testing guide.

npm run build
Creates an optimized production-ready build in the build directory.\
The files are bundled and minified for best performance, with hashed filenames for caching.

Your app will then be ready to deploy.\
More details are available in the deployment guide.

npm run eject
Caution: This action is irreversible. Once executed, it cannot be undone.

If the default configurations do not meet your requirements, you can use eject to gain full control. This will copy all configuration files and dependencies (e.g., Webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project. Afterward, you will manage these dependencies manually.

Most users do not need to eject since the provided setup works well for small and medium-scale projects. Use this feature only if you are certain.
